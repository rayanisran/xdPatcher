# Batch xdelta Patcher

This tool allows you to apply a bunch of xdelta files at once, without having to create copies of the original ROM and applying each patch separately. Just select a folder that contains all the patches and click an `Apply` button.

## Instructions

1. Place the original ROM and your xdelta files in the same directory.  
2. Open the app and select the original ROM (file), and the folder for the xdelta patches. The output directory is automatically set to a new folder called `Patched` in the root directory.  
3. Click the apply patches button.

## Requirements

.NET Framework 4.8.
